# Exo Wethenew

This project is a react test made for the company wethenew. The goal of this project is to display a list and product page based on json data.
To create this project I used with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Architecture

In the `public` folder you going to find public and static data. Here I placed the `json` file.
In the `src` folder are placed all files used to make app work correctly.
<br/>
Folder `components` contain all reusable components.
<br/>
Folder `modules` contain all datas logic. Here you can place reducer if needed.
<br/>
Folder `pages` contain all page components.

## Get started

Clone the repo and run the `npm start` or `yarn start` command to run the project.

Feel free to contact me.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:
Feel free to use `yarn` if you prefer both work.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
